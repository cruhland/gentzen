- Formula "templates" in rule figures
    - Determine if a formula template matches a formula
        - Substitute free object variable
- Rule figures and derivations
    - Apply a rule figure to a step in a proof figure to convert it to a
      valid derivation, or fail with a reason
      - Use set of rules from Gentzen's paper to test
      - Failure reason: incompatible with assumption
      - Failure reason: variable restriction not obeyed
    - List unproven assumptions of a derivation (if any)
- Use derivations as "rules" (theorems)
- Rework legacy tests
- Delete unused test generator code
- Clean up all code and add comments
- Formula parser
    - Expand definition of whitespace, add tests for parsing extra whitespace
    - Forbid nonprintable characters in formulas
    - Switch to using Scala's parser combinators
    - Write tests for parsing failures
    - Code cleanup and comments
- Rendering (maybe parsing?) for general Formulas
