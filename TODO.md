- Formula figures: the formula "templates" in rule figures
    - Determine if a formula matches a formula figure
        - Formula variables and constants
        - Assumptions
        - Contains object variable (free or bound)
        - Substitute object variable
- Rule figures and derivations
    - Formulas can be converted into no-assumption derivations
    - Combine a set of derivations and a rule figure to produce
      another derivation, or fail with a reason
    - List unproven assumptions of a derivation (if any)
- Use derivations as "rules" (theorems)
- Formula parser
    - Expand definition of whitespace, add tests for parsing extra whitespace
    - Forbid nonprintable characters in formulas
    - Switch to using Scala's parser combinators
    - Write tests for parsing failures
    - Code cleanup and comments
